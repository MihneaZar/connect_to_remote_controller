SCANNING DOESNT WORK TOP LEFT

heres another thought: if activating defenses pisses enemies off, why activate?
or it could be u r sent in randomly, and may lose immediately
random chance of station being offline from start (signifying lost area)

E  = engineer
RC = remote controller
S  = system  
D  = destructor
V  = venator



// forget about everything from before
you have very little time (~0.1s) to save the system
every action takes a tiny fraction of time, partially random

OR 

puzzle minigames (such as binary grid, nonogram, lightline, wordle?, etc.) -> the time it takes you is proportional to the time cost
harder puzzle types for more powerful abilities?

OR 

puzzles where solution isnt clear until you submit it, and mistakes cost more
